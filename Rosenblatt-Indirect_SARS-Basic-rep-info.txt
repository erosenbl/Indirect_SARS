Title: Code for "Fomites could determine severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in low-density white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations"


This repository contains all of the scripts to reproduce the analyses, figures, and tables associated with the manuscript Rosenblatt et al. in prep. This RMarkdown file that steps through the estimation of parameters that allow:
1.  Compile estimated and derived parameters for both indirect and direct transmission pathways for SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer and humans;
2.  Project outbreaks using SIRS ODEs modified from the whitetailedSIRS package (Rosenblatt et al. 2023), and estimate cumulative Force of Infection (FOI) considering both direct and indirect transmission pathways;
3.  Evaluate sensitivity of outbreaks to FOI and basic reproductive number (R0), and thus identify when increases in FOI from indirect transmission most alter outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in deer;
4.  And describe the prevalence and distribution of deer population segments across the contiguous US that may be sensitive to the increased burden of indirect transmission pathways.
